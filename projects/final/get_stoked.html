			<h2 id="title">WeeklyStoke Newsletter</h2>
		<div id="left">
			<p>So here’s to our first WeeklyStoke post ever. Yeah, we’re new at this kind of thing, so bear with us here..</p>
			<p>First and foremost we want to SINCERELY thank all of you who have helped support our <strong>Kickstarter campaign</strong>. Seriously. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We think you’re the greatest human beings in the world. There’s just 24 hours left on it and we’re only 1k short of meeting our stretch goal, so if you feel like sharing it with your friends or e-mailing them the link, that would be extra super awesome. Again, we can’t thank you enough. For serious.</p>
			<p>Running a Kickstarter is an emotional roller coaster. We literally put our entire lives on hold, left our jobs, put all our money into this (after validating it for the last year and a half) and then crossed our fingers. We’re all or nothing, go big or go home kind of people and we really didn’t see any other way of doing this. Up until hitting 15k it was a nail biter for sure, but here we are now getting ready to purchase manufacturing equipment and start fulfilling orders once this baby ends and the funds clear. This is SUCH a good feeling but at the same time we’re, as of now, just two guys and not some large company like Patagonia who can just design and pump out gear at the snap of a finger. We’re also perfectionists to a larger extent and want everyone to have as much of a “HELL YES” moment as possible when you get your package in the mail. So our challenges are ahead of us, but we’re enthusiastically looking forward to them.</p>

		<div id="right">
			<p>We’re just as excited to start writing our weekly letter to get everyone here starting their weeks by yelling things like ‘HECK YES!’ at their computer screens. yes, that’s our goal. Hope you can deal with it. From the new products we’ll be sharing (and we will be letting WeeklyStoke subscribers in on our next developments soon here) to the peak performance advice from some top minds in the action sports industry, to the news that will be of the type that may cause you to stand up out of your computer chair with excitement and possibly have to explain, or not, what’s going on to the confused onlookers around you. Well, that’s the big idea any way.</p>
			<p>Our mission with Epicstoke, as the name implies, is to share and spread the stoke on a larger scale.  Not only through our gear, but through social innovation as well. If everyone in the world was passionate and fired up about something, we think it’d be a bit nicer place. We’re guessing you feel the same.</p>
			<p>Again, thank you all so much, we’re looking forward to going on this adventure with you all, and never stop spreading your stoke!</p>
