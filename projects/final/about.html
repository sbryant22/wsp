			<h3 id="brief_story">The Brief Story</h3>
			<p class="kickstarters">Hey Kickstarters! So the story goes... we were in search of the perfect way to make the perfect wallet. Basically a wallet that was:</p>
				<ul class="kickstarters_list">
					<li>versatile yet fits your precise needs</li>
					<li>enjoyable to use, thin, durable, & protects valuables from the elements</li>
					<li>can be broken in like leather but won't get wet like it</li>
					<li>one of a kind, has great design, and tells a story</li>
					<li>Oh, and is locally made from high quality recycled or sustainable resources</li>
				</ul>
			<div id="left_column">
			<p>Impossible? Almost, but not quite.</p>
			<p>We realized that there was one main ingredient aside from great design necessary to fulfill all those requirements: <strong>a perfect material- billboard vinyl</strong>. It has everything we ever hoped and wished for. And aside from being a designer's dream, by purchasing a wallet you are saving something that doesn't like to break down from going into landfills or being burned into the air.</p>
			<!--<p><strong>It's really a win / win / win situation.</strong></p>-->
			<!--<p>After scouring the earth for ideas we came up with four designs based on today's demands. We're acknowledgers of the fact that one size seldom fits all and different life styles and situations create different wallet needs.</p>-->
			</div>
			<div id="right_column">
			<p>We just want to sincerely thank all of you in advance for taking the time to read this and for those of you who decide to support this in any way, <strong>you rock.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Please help share this story</strong> with your friends on facebook, twitter, email or your preferred sharing mechanism, whatever it may be- we really appreciate it!</p>
			</div>
			<!--<p class="note"><strong>note: Every item on here is at a special low price just for Kickstarters.</strong></p>-->

			<!--<h3>RFID Blocking Technology:</h3>-->
			<!--<div id="left_column">-->
			<!--<p>RFID blocking is optional and only applies to the Ole, I.D., and Gentleman wallets as we designed these wallets with this option in mind. This option is included in the price as a special thanks to you and we'll ask you if you want it when we collect your information at the end of the Kickstarter.</p>-->
			<!--<p>Since the high tech material we're using (Cryptalloy) is only 0.1mm thick, it can seamlessly fit between layers of the above three wallets without any notice or appearance change what so ever. It's a near magical material that blocks all common frequencies.</p>-->
			<!--</div>-->
			<!--<div id="right_colu">-->
			<!--<p>For you techies, we've listed technical details in the FAQs which after reading we're sure you'll see why we're so excited about this option!</p>-->
			<!--<p>"CRYPTALLOY is a high tech RFID shielding foil which blocks RFID signals of all current RFID frequencies. It protects digital privacy. As an inner layer it turns items like wallets into data safes for personal and biometric data. Certified by TÃœV (Germany) the RFID blocking material protects from unauthorized access to the data encoded on RFID/NFC chips."</p>-->

			<!--<h3>Risks and Challenges:</h3>
			<p>Risks:</p>
			<div id="left_column">
			<p>Our personal biggest risk is getting the word out to other Kickstarters and making this happen. We've already left our jobs and have self funded this the entire way up until now. The bottom line is, we need to go big or go home here and we'd much rather go big. </p>
			<p>Production wise, all the vinyl is sourced in the United States and rest assured, it would take much more than millions of orders to run out of this stuff- it's unreal / daunting how much is out there.</p>-->
			
			<!--<p>It's possible that we could run out of one particular color if this goes viral. The good news is, it's not hard to find other billboards with rad/similar colors and we'd gladly welcome this issue any day and be able to offer</p>
			</div>-->
			
			<!--<div id="right_col">-->
			<!--<p>Kickstarters other great alternatives. On that note, as long as you order early, you can ensure getting the color you want as well.</p>-->
			<!--<p>We have two sewers that we work with- one incredible family right here in Minneapolis, as well as an outfit in northern Minnesota that not only uses American made everything (even their thread), but also produces some of the high end bags for brands like Mountainsmith. Needless to say, we've found some real pros who know how to make high quality items and are used to dealing with large orders.</p>-->
